M102 - General notes
====================
I decided to attend to the [M102: MongoDB for DBAs](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M102/about) and successfully completed.

This repo contains my general notes, taken on the fly while watching the video courses. I may need them as a reminder for later and it *might* help someone else ...
